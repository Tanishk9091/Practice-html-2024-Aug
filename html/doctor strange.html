    <p>Dr. Stephen Vincent Strange is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Steve Ditko, the character first appeared in Strange Tales #110 (cover-dated July 1963). Doctor Strange serves as the Sorcerer Supreme, the primary protector of Earth against magical and mystical threats. Strange was introduced during the Silver Age of Comic Books in an attempt to bring a different kind of character and themes of mysticism to Marvel Comics. <br>

        The character starts as an intelligent and egotistically arrogant neurosurgeon who is injured in a car accident. Because his hands had suffered severe nerve damage from the accident, he was told that current medical therapy and rehabilitation would not be enough to enable him to practice again as a surgeon. Unable to accept this prognosis, he travels the world searching for alternative ways of healing, which leads him to the Ancient One, the Sorcerer Supreme. Strange becomes his student and learns to be a master of both the mystical and the martial arts. <br> He acquires an assortment of mystical objects, including the powerful Eye of Agamotto and Cloak of Levitation, and takes up residence in a mansion referred to as the Sanctum Sanctorum, located at 177A Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, Manhattan, New York City. Strange assumes the title of Sorcerer Supreme and, with his friend and valet Wong, defends the world from mystical threats.

<h2><center>BIOGRAPHY</center></h2>
<P>
    Stephen Vincent Strange, M.D., Ph.D., is a brilliant but highly egotistical fictional doctor. He was born in Philadelphia and raised in New York City.[51] After high school, he went to New York College as a pre-med student, entered medical school at Columbia University and completed his residency at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, where his success made him arrogant.[52][53][54]

Despite his reputation for being able to handle even the most complicated surgical procedures, Strange is self-centered and greedy, and only treats patients who can afford to pay his exorbitant fees. One night, while speeding in his car, a terrible accident shatters the bones in his hands, leading to extensive nerve damage. He soon finds that his fingers tremble uncontrollably, rendering him unable to perform surgery. Too vain to accept a teaching job, Strange desperately searches for a way to fix his hands and subsequently wastes all of his money on expensive, but unsuccessful treatments.

Broke and ostracized from his colleagues, Strange becomes a drifter.  <br> He happens to overhear two sailors in a bar discussing a hermit called the Ancient One (who is actually the Earth's Sorcerer Supreme) in the Himalayas, who can heal any ailment. Despite not personally believing in magic, Strange uses the last of his money to track down the aged mystic. The Ancient One refuses to help Strange due to his arrogance, but senses a good side that he attempts to bring to the surface. He fails, but Strange then commits a heroic act when he discovers the Ancient One's disciple, Baron Mordo, attempting to kill his mentor and usurp his power.

<h3><center>POWERS AND ABILITIES</center></h3>
<p>
    Doctor Strange is a fictional practicing sorcerer who draws his powers from mystical entities such as Agamotto, Cyttorak, Ikonn, Oshtur, Raggadorr, and Watoomb, who lend their energies for spells.[62] Strange also wields mystical artifacts including the Cloak of Levitation which enables him to fly;[note 1] the Eye of Agamotto, an amulet whose light is used to negate evil magic;[56] the Book of the Vishanti, a grimoire which contains vast knowledge of white magic;[63][64]: 26–27  and the Orb of Agamotto, a crystal ball which is used for clairvoyance.[64]: 24–27 [65]

In addition to his magical abilities, Strange is trained in several martial arts disciplines,[66] including judo,[67] and has shown proficiency with numerous magically conjured weapons including swords and axes.[68] Strange was a skilled neurosurgeon before nerve damage impaired his hands.[56]

Doctor Strange is described as "the mightiest magician in the cosmos"[69] and "more powerful by far than any of your fellow humanoids" by Eternity, the sentience of the Marvel Universe.[70] He holds the title of Sorcerer Supreme beginning with the 1973 storyline in which the Ancient One dies,[21] and retains the title thereafter, except during an interruption from 1992[71] to 1995.[72] He relinquishes the title once again in a 2009 storyline,[38] but reclaims it in a 2012 story when he proves himself willing to protect the world even without the title.[42]
